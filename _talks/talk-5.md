We utilize the Navier-Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation. The governing equations can be written as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g} \rho+\mathbf{F}(z) \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) T = \kappa_T \nabla^2 T\\
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) S = \kappa_S \nabla^2 S
$$
