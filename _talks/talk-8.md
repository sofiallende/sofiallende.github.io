In the 3D simulations with constant initial conditions for temperature and salinity, we observe that the first excited mode leads to an unstable density profile, with heavier layers overlying lighter ones, for all Lewis numbers greater than 1. Here, we explore this instability by varying the initial conditions, ranging from a uniform profile in the vertical direction to a stratified one. Additionally, we examine the effects of different Le values.



1. Uniform temperature and salinity:

$$
T_i(x,y,z)=273.3\\
S_i(x,y,z)=34.572
$$

2. Uniform salinity and stratified temperature:

$$
T_i(x,y,z)=273.3
S_i(x,y,z)=35
$$


3. Uniform temperature and stratified salinity:

$$
T_i(x,y,z)=273.3
S_i(x,y,z)=33-4*z
$$


4.Stratified temperature and salinity:
