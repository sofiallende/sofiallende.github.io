### Preprint ! Soon the final version


We evaluate the vertical turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) mixing scheme of the NEMO-SI3 ocean–sea ice general circulation model in sea ice-covered regions of the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, we assess the parameters involved in the TKE mixed layer penetration (MLP) parameterization. This ad-hoc parameterization aims to capture processes such as near-inertial oscillations, ocean swells, and waves that impact the ocean surface boundary layer, which are often not well-represented in the default TKE scheme. We evaluate this parameterization for the first time in three regions of the Arctic Ocean: the Makarov, Eurasian, and Canada Basins.
