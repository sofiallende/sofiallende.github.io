<!--The fragmentation of small, brittle, flexible, inextensible fibres is investigated in a fully developed, homogeneous, isotropic turbulent flow. Such small fibres spend most of their time fully stretched and their dynamics follows that of stiff rods. They can then break through tensile failure, i.e. when the tension is higher than a given threshold. Fibres bend when experiencing a strong compression. During these rare and intermittent buckling events, they can break under flexural failure, i.e. when the curvature exceeds a threshold. Fine-scale massive simulations of both the fluid flow and the fibre dynamics are performed to provide statistics on these two fragmentation processes. This gives ingredients for the development of accurate macroscopic models, namely the fragmentation rate and daughter-size distributions, which can be used to predict the time evolution of the fibre size distribution. -->

The fragmentation of small, brittle, flexible, inextensible fibres is investigated in a fully developed, homogeneous, isotropic turbulent flow.

Fibres bend when experiencing a strong compression. During these rare and intermittent buckling events, they can break under flexural failure, i.e. when the curvature exceeds a threshold.
