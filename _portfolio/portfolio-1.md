My recent work focuses on studying the oceanic mixed layer in the Arctic Ocean, involving complex physical interactions between ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere. This work is based on systematic statistical analyses of oceanographic datasets from general circulation models, in situ observation campaigns, and satellite data.

NEMO-SI3 model

We aim here to assess the ability of the mixing turbulent kinetic energy scheme to reproduce the upper ocean and sea ice properties along the Arctic Ocean. 
We use the NEMO-SI3 general circulation model forced by ERA-5 reanalysis.
