These studies focus on non-spherical particles transported by turbulent flow. The main objective was to examine, in detail, from the point of view of their statistics, the dynamics of small complex particles immersed in turbulent flows. Two main aspects were explored: the flexibility of the particles through the use of flexible fibers and their interaction with the fluid structure in terms of transport and distribution by integrating spheroids into the turbulent flow. We used the pseudo-spectral DNS code LaTu to perform massive numerical simulations on local (Azzurra at UCA, CEMEF cluster, NEF at INRIA) and national (Jean-Zay at IDRIS) clusters.
