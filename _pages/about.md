My current scientific work relates to the field of turbulence, and focuses on the fine statistical study of the turbulent dynamics of small complex particles. Those kind of dynamics apear in both industrial and natural environments, from micro-algae that can clog the cooling circuits of thermal power plants, to diatoms that can be preferentialy concentrate at kilometric scales in the Arctic seas.
