My thesis analyses the dynamics of small complex objects, such as fibers or spheroids, that interact with a turbulent random environment. The aim is to gain a physical understanding of how turbulent fluctuations affect the dynamics of non-spherical particles, inducing phenomena such as preferential concentration, deformation, or catastrophic events such as their fragmentation. Such developments pave the way for the design of stochastic parameterizations of violent events in industrial codes.
