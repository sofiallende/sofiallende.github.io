I am Sofia Allende, a postdoctoral researcher specializing in physics and oceanography. My research focuses on the physical processes at the ocean-sea ice boundary. My work is based on systematic statistical exploitation of high-numerical resolutions, large oceanographic data sets from general circulation models, in situ observational campaigns, and satellite data.


Currently, I am working on the Ocean-Sea Ice Interaction (OSII) project, funded by a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship. Our goal is to unravel the multiphysics processes occurring at the ocean-sea ice boundary, promising a more precise understanding of ice melting rates and boundary-layer dynamics resulting from the complex interplay of internal waves, tides, and double diffusion convection.

My previous work focuses on studying the oceanic mixed layer in the Arctic Ocean, involving complex physical interactions between the ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere. Additionally, my scientific work relates to the field of turbulence and focuses on the fine statistical study of the turbulent dynamics of small complex particles. Such particles appear in both industrial and natural environments, from micro-algae that can clog the cooling circuits of thermal power plants to diatoms that preferentially concentrate on kilometric scales in the Arctic seas. 




## Affiliations
I am  an associate professor  at  Université Côte d'Azur,  affiliated jointly  
- with the [out-of-equilibrium and non-linear physics team](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/research/nonlinear-physics-complex-fluids-and-biophysics){:target="_blank"} at  [Institut de Physique de Nice](https://inphyni.univ-cotedazur.eu/){:target="_blank"}  for research
- and with the  [Polytech Nice Sophia engineering school](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr/) for  teaching.


## Research

My research activities address the stochastic modeling of turbulent patterns, combining insights from observations, direct numerical simulations and  solvable  minimal models. In the past  years, I have been working  on problems involving  an interplay between singularities  and predictability, more specifically focusing on

- the statistical modeling of intermittency, 

- blowup scenarios in fluid models, 

- the spontaneous stochasticity phenomenon.  

*Those topics offer many exciting projects for prospective Master/PhD students and postdocs. Any inquiry, please  feel free to contact me.*
